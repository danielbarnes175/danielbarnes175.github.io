# Boss Fight Battlegrounds

Now this one was a fun one. I worked on it with a team of 3 other students for Com S 309, or Software Development Practices, in Fall 2019. We ended up being voted the #1 best project out of 78 projects. We worked hard on this project, and it paid off when we had a working game at the end of the semester.

The game was developed almost entirely from scratch. We built it on top of the Monogame framework, which handles two main things: rendering and the game loop. Everything else, such as servers, textures, the game engine, physics, gameplay, and so much more was entirely up to us.

So, how did we do it?
