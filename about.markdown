My name is Daniel. I'm currently a Senior at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering. I created the motto "Develop, Inspire, Create" because those are the core tenants of my life. 

What do those words mean to you? I can tell you what they mean to me. To me, the phrase invokes a feeling of wanting to improve. It invokes a feeling of wanting to do something bigger, and grander. That's exactly why I made this website. I wanted a platform where I could take the core tenants of my life- develop, inspire, create- and share them with the world.

So I ask of you to join me on this journey, and together we can live our lives developing, inspiring, and creating.
