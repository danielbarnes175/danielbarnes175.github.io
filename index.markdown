I love to create new things, and become the very best possible version of myself. I have done this time and time again, be it with my projects, ranging from a fully-fledged multiplayer game, to a chatbot that facilitates running a server, or even implementing a camera that uses OpenCV to track your face and follow you around as you move. I like creating so much, in fact, that I created an animation program just so I would be able to customize animations with exactly the tools I needed.

I have many strengths that I have gained from previous work experience, school, and personal projects. I have learned how to create and organize a project using Agile principles. I've learned how to set up and interact with a database, how to move projects down the pipeline from conception to production, and how to take an idea and bring it to life. I have worked with specific technologies such as Node.js, MySQL, .NET Core, and Amazon Web Services.

With all of these skills, I will be a strong addition to your team. I will bring the drive to succeed, and the strengths to back it up in order to improve both myself, and the company.
